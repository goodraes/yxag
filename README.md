　　在装满母爱的水盆里，我洗去了一路风尘。厨房里飘出了袅袅炊烟。无声的岁月在这一次次飘飞的炊烟里无言地流逝着。锅里煮沸的是妈妈苦心经营的悠然从容的日子。走进厨房，想帮妈做点什么。妈说，你带着孩子坐了半天车，一定累坏了，刚洗干净，不要进来再弄脏了。和你妹妹拉呱去吧！你们也一年没见面了。看着孩子们在小院里嘻闹着，和妹妹聊着各自的生活，聊着各自孩子成长中的点滴辛酸与欢乐……妈妈就把饭菜端上了餐桌。
	7、安心的幸福莫过于三件事：有人信你，有人陪你，有人等你。

In the tub filled with a mother's love, I wash the pick-up.
Smoke wafted up from the kitchen.
Silent years at this time and time again mutely goes by the amount of wood smoke.
Pot boiling is mom elaboration of carefree and leisurely life.
Went into the kitchen, I want to do something for mom.
Mom said, you take the children spent half a day, must be very tired, just wash it, it don't come in dirty again.
And your sister go to chit-chat!
You also haven't seen each other for a year.
Watched the children at play in small courtyard, with their own life, good chat and sister some bits of bitterness and joy with their children to grow up...
Mother put the food on the table.
7, peace of mind of happiness than three things: someone believe you, someone to accompany you, someone waiting for you.
